# Aipaca's Challenge Starter Code for UW CxC Summit

Hello students! Welcome to CxC Summit's Aipaca Data Challenge. You will build an alpaca binary classifier and deploy your model with the Aibro inference tool.

# Supported Environment
Python 3.7 and 3.8 are most recommended. Other python3 versions may cause unexpected errors. Don't use Python 3.10.

# Getting Started

## Step 1: Get an account

Join Aipaca's [Discord community](https://discord.gg/bYB7EuXzWW). Then, register for an Aipaca account at https://aipaca.ai.

## Step 2: Download the data

Download the alpaca training data from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1JlEHvLpuLWsio3rZZaok_2tjSlhXxBfG

## Step 3: Deploy the template model

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/aipaca-mlops/cxc_datathon.git`.
2. **(Optional)** Create a virtual environment by `python3 -m venv venv`, and activate it by `. venv/bin/activate`. If you are a Windows user, use `. venv/Script/activate`. For more details, check out [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52816156/how-to-create-virtual-environment-for-python-3-7-0).
3. Install the newest version of aibro by `pip install aibro`.
4. Run `python3 turnon_deploy.py`. You will be asked to input your Aipaca account's email & password. We recommend you to use an [access token](https://doc.aipaca.ai/inference#authentication) instead.
5. After step 4, you will receive an inference API URL. You can input the URL into `test_api.sh` then use `bash test_api.sh` to test your API.

## Step 4: Turn off your inference API

Go to [Inference Jobs Console](https://aipaca.ai/inference_jobs) and copy your job ID by clicking on it. Replace the ID in `turnoff_deploy.py` and run `python turnoff_deploy.py` to terminate your instance.

Note that everything deployed should eventually be turned off to avoid extra costs.  

## Step 5: Deploy your own model

You now know how to turn on/off an inference API by the template model. It's time to create your own APIs!

Modify `model.py` and `predict.py` with respect to your own alpaca classifier. As long as `run(load_model())` from `predict.py` can return the prediction result, your model repository is ready to deploy. You can find more inference examples at [Aibro-examples](https://github.com/aipaca-mlops/Aibro-examples). For marking purposes, please make sure that your API return is a dictionary, where the key is the image file name and the value is the inference result. Feel free to add other artifacts if there is a need.

Before the final deployment, we recommend you to turn on `DRYRUN` in `turnon_deploy.py` to validate your model repository. Once `DRYRUN` test is passed, you can turn off `DRYRUN` and start the deployment.

## Step 6: Submit to [Aipaca leaderboard](https://aipaca.ai/events)

The submission includes nickname, student number, inference URL, and github URL. Your result will be automatically scored according to challenge requirements. If the score didnâ€™t show up, you can contact us and we will look into your code.

## Tips

- Remember to update `requirement.txt` if your model is built by extra libraries.
- The Colab inference demo and documentation are all available on https://aipaca.ai.
- If you found any technical issues, feel free to contact Aipaca's **Admin** team in Aipaca's [Discord community](https://discord.gg/bYB7EuXzWW). If you are not a Discord user, you can also send us an email to hello@aipaca.ai.
