# Aipaca Datathon Starter Code for CxC UW

Hello students, welcome to CxC Summit's Aipaca Data Challenge. You will build an alpaca binary classifier and deploy your model with the Aibro inference tool.

# Getting Started

## Step 1

Go to https://aipaca.ai and join Aipaca's [Discord community](https://discord.gg/bYB7EuXzWW). Then, register for an Aipaca account.

## Step 2

Download the alpaca training data from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1JlEHvLpuLWsio3rZZaok_2tjSlhXxBfG

## Step 3

Build and train your alpaca classifier with your chosen frameworks.

## Step 4

Clone this repository and try to run `python turnon_deploy.py` with your own Aipaca account. The repository used a random classifier as the example.

## Step 5

Modify `model.py` and `predict.py` with respect to your own alpaca classifier and deploy it. Please make sure that your API return is a dictionary, where the key is the image file name and the value is the inference result. Feel free to add other artifacts if there is a need.

## Tips

- Remember to update `requirement.txt` if your model is built by extra libraries.
- You can find more inference examples at [Aibro-examples](https://github.com/aipaca-mlops/Aibro-examples).
- The Colab inference demo and documentation are all available on https://aipaca.ai.
- If you found any technical issues, feel free to contact Aipaca's **Admin** team in Aipaca's [Discord community](https://discord.gg/bYB7EuXzWW). If you are not a Discord user, you can also send us an email to hello@aipaca.ai.
