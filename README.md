# Aipaca Datathon Starter Code for CxC UW

Hello students, welcome to Aipaca Datathon. In the datathon, you will build a alpaca binary classifier and deploy your model by Aibro inference tool.

# Get Start

## Step 1

Join Aipaca's Discord community and register an Aipaca account at https://aipaca.ai

## Step 2

Download alpaca training data from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1JlEHvLpuLWsio3rZZaok_2tjSlhXxBfG

## Step 3

Build and train your alpaca classifier with your favorate frameworks.

## Step 4

Clone this repository and try to run `python turnon_deploy.py` with your own Aipaca account. The repository used a random classifier as the example.

## Step 5

Modify `model.py` and `predict.py` by your own alpaca classifier and deploy it. Please make sure that your API return is a dictionary, where the key is the image file name and the value is the inference result. Please also feel free to add other artifacts if there is any need.

## Tips

- Remember to update `requirement.txt` if your model is built by extra libraries.
- You can find more inference examples at [Aibro-examples](https://github.com/aipaca-mlops/Aibro-examples).
- Colab inference demo and documentations are all available on https://aipaca.ai.
- If you found any technical issues, feel free to contact Aipaca's **Admin** team in Aipaca's [Discord community](https://discord.gg/bYB7EuXzWW). If you are not a Discord user, you can also report to hello@aipaca.ai.
